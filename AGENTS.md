# Agent Instructions

Rules for AI coding agents working in this repo.
Human contributors should start with [CONTRIBUTING.md][contribFile].

This file is the short version and always applies.
The reasoning behind each rule is in [docs/Styleguide.md][styleguideFile].

## Before changing anything

- Match the surrounding code first.
  Its existing patterns, spacing, and naming outrank every rule below.
- Follow instructions written in code comments where you find them.
- Read the rule file in [.github/instructions/][instructionsFolder]
  that matches the file type you are about to edit.

## Use the reviewers and the procedures

Specialist reviewers live in [.claude/agents/][agentsFolder] and procedures in
[.claude/skills/][skillsFolder]. Every tool here discovers them by itself.
What none of them can discover is when to reach for one:

- Run `/review` **before** opening a pull request, not after.
  It sizes itself to the change, so a small diff costs almost nothing.
- Use `/commit` rather than composing a message by hand,
  and `/pr` rather than writing a description from memory.
- Use `/release` to cut a release,
  rather than working the workflow from memory.
- The reviewers are **read-only by design**. They report; you decide what to
  change. Never ask one to fix what it found.

[docs/AiInstructions.md][aiFile] explains the whole layout.

## Never commit to `main`

Create a descriptive branch (for example, `awesome-feature-name`),
then open a pull request.
Direct pushes to `main` are rejected by the repo rulesets anyway.

## Line width

- [.editorconfig][editorConfigFile] draws three vertical rulers:
  the target, the occasional allowance, and the hard limit.
  Wrap by the target wherever you can.
- Break at commas, periods, semicolons, or the end of a complete phrase —
  never mid-thought.
  In code, stack arguments and chained calls vertically.
- **Don't orphan a single word.**
  If wrapping would leave one word alone on the next line,
  run a few characters over the target instead.
- Relax this only where wrapping is impossible, such as a long URL.

See [docs/VerticalRulers.md][rulersFile] for details.

## Files

- Encoding, indentation, whitespace, and the final newline
  are set per file type in [.editorconfig][editorConfigFile];
  line endings in [.gitattributes][gitAttributesFile].
  Read them rather than assuming a language's usual defaults.
  HTML and CSS, which neither covers, indent with 2 spaces.
- `git add` refuses a file whose line endings are wrong for its type —
  *LF would be replaced by CRLF* — so a stray one blocks the commit
  rather than being fixed silently.
- Don't restate either file's rules anywhere else.

## Comments

- Explain **why**, not **what**.
  Needing to explain what the code does means the code should be refactored.
- Keep them short. Walls of text don't get read.
- Delete a comment the moment it stops being true.
  A stale comment is worse than no comment.

## Commits

- [Conventional Commits][ccFile]: `type(scope)!: description`,
  plus a custom `infra` type for Terraform, GitHub settings,
  and other DevOps changes.
- Imperative present tense: "change", not "changed" or "changes".
- One concern per commit. Group related edits together
  rather than committing file by file.
- A body, when one is needed, is a few lines on **why**.
  Never a narrative.

## Pull requests

- The description says why, what changed, and how it was verified:
  a sentence or two and a few bullets, not an essay.
- A review comment or reply makes one point in a sentence or two,
  and names the commit that addresses it when there is one.
  Don't restate the diff, and don't pad with thanks.

## Code

- Small functions. Focused, cohesive classes. Follow [SOLID][solid].
- Favor explicit over implicit,
  and consistency over any particular convention.
- Document public types and members.
- Validate all input, apply least privilege,
  and keep dependencies current.
- Include tests: unit tests covering every public code path,
  plus a few integration tests.
  Aim for the coverage [codecov.yml][codecovFile] enforces on changed lines,
  without sacrificing test quality for the metric.

## Emoji

Functional emoji are welcome:
status markers (✅ ⚠️ ❌), file trees (📁 📄), and scanning aids in tables.
Decorative emoji are not — except in community-health boilerplate carried
over from an external template (`CONTRIBUTING.md`,
`pull_request_template.md`), which is left as imported.
