`docs/ReleaseProcess.md` has the reasoning; this is the runbook. The version
is decided by the commits and `GitVersion.yml`, and the binaries were built
by CI when the commit landed — you choose *whether* to release, never what
number or what bits.

## Before drafting

1. Confirm `main` is what should ship: `git fetch`, `git log origin/main -1`,
   and `gh run list --branch main --limit 3` to see that the CI run for that
   commit succeeded. Red or still running means wait.
2. Work out the version the draft will carry: `gh release list --limit 5`
   for the last tag, `git log <last-tag>..origin/main --oneline` for what
   has landed since, and `docs/ReleaseProcess.md` for which commit types
   bump what. If that is not the version wanted, stop — the fix is a commit
   (`+semver:` in a body, or `next-version` in `GitVersion.yml`), and CI has
   to build it before a release can carry it.
3. If that version is already tagged, stop. It has been published, and the
   workflow refuses to replace it.

## Draft

`gh workflow run draft-release.yml --ref main` — the same as `Actions` →
`Draft Release` → `Run workflow` → `main` in the web UI. Find the run with
`gh run list --workflow draft-release.yml --limit 1` and `gh run watch` it.

Re-running replaces the draft for that version rather than adding a second,
so a failed or wrong attempt costs nothing.

If the notes open with an HTML comment instead of a paragraph, the summary
model was unavailable — `COPILOT_PAT` missing or expired, or the service
down. The draft is still good: write the paragraph by hand at review, or
delete the draft and re-run later.

## Review

`gh release list` shows the draft; `gh release view <tag>` shows its body
and assets. Report each of these and wait for the human to confirm them:

- the version is the one worked out above;
- the CI artifacts are attached;
- the notes read correctly, and every breaking change is explained.

If anything is wrong, `gh release delete <tag>` removes the draft. Nothing
else has happened.

## Publish

Publishing is the deployment. It creates the tag, which is what the next
version is calculated from, and fires the repo's `publish-release.yml` if it
has one. It cannot be undone: the tag is protected by ruleset and
the published assets are immutable.

Never publish without explicit confirmation in this conversation. Then
`gh release edit <tag> --draft=false`, and report the release URL.
