## Line Length and Readability

This project encourages keeping code lines relatively short
to facilitate side-by-side comparisons and enhance readability.
See [Vertical Rulers][rulersFile] for details on
the recommended line lengths and how to configure your IDE.

## Analyzers and Formatters

This project uses a combination of tools to enforce rules
concerning files and their contents:

- The [.gitattributes][gitAttributesFile] file is responsible for
  low-level file concerns such as encoding and line endings,
  so they can differ as needed to match the user's machine and OS.
- The [.editorconfig][editorConfigFile] file is responsible for
  generic style rules to be enforced across all files.
  - Some IDEs have this functionality built-in, and some require a plugin.
    [Check the website][editorConfig] to see how to configure your environment.
- Additional code analyzers installed in a given project
  might require their own configuration files in addition to the ones above
  (e.g., [eslint.config.js][esLint], [.prettierrc][prettier],
  [stylecop.json][styleCop], etc.).
  These should _defer to_ (and not conflict with) the previous tools
  and should only be added as needed.

Make sure to address any errors, warnings, or messages
before submitting a Pull Request.

## Code Style

Beyond the required styling rules enforced above,
try to simply follow any existing style in the code
and focus on making it as readable as possible:

- Functions should be small.
- Classes should be focused and cohesive.
- Follow the [SOLID][solid] principles.
- Public classes and members should be documented.
- Favor explicit over implicit code.
- Favor consistency over any specific convention.
- Follow language-specific conventions ([C#][csCoding]).

Remember the adage:

> Always code as if the next developer who inherits your work
> is a violent sociopath who knows where you live!

## Naming Conventions

Naming is hard! But clear, consistent naming is crucial for code readability:

- Use descriptive, meaningful names that reveal intent
- Follow language-specific conventions ([C#][csIdentifier])
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're well-known (e.g., `DB`, `AI`, etc.)
- Prefer verbose, clear names over short, cryptic ones
- Keep them relatively short when possible
- Test names are generally an exception to these rules;
  follow the conventions used by other tests in the project

## Code Comments

Code comments can be very helpful to explain _why_
a chunk of code is doing what it's doing.
However, if you're tempted to explain _what_ it's doing,
that's a good sign the code should be refactored.
Code should be self-documenting in that regard.

## Documentation

Documentation should be clear, concise, and up-to-date.
When adding or modifying features,
be sure to update any relevant documentation.
All documentation follows [Markdown][markdown] formatting rules.
Diagrams should use [PlantUML][plantUml] (for independent documents)
or [Mermaid][mermaid] (for in-line diagrams in Markdown).

## Error Handling

Exceptions are for exceptional circumstances, not for control flow;
an exception that is swallowed without a reason is a bug in waiting.
Log enough to diagnose the failure later.

For details, follow [Microsoft's best practices for exceptions][exceptions].

## Security

Write code with security in mind rather than auditing it in afterwards.
Validate input at the boundary, apply least privilege,
keep dependencies current, and never build a query by concatenation.

Two references cover this far better than a list here would:
the [OWASP Top Ten][owasp] for the categories of risk,
and the [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][owaspCheatSheets]
for what to do about a specific one.

## Performance

Favor algorithmic efficiency over micro-optimization,
and measure before optimizing anything —
an assumption about a hot path is usually wrong.
Be deliberate about allocations, round trips, and blocking calls
in code that runs often.

## Testing

All code contributions should include appropriate tests.
Tests should be comprehensive and verify both expected behavior
and edge cases/error conditions.

In general, follow the principles of the [Test Pyramid][testPyramid]:

- Unit tests for public functions, covering all possible code paths.
  This is where most of the work will be done.
  It's even possible to have more test code than production code here.
- Some integration tests as necessary, covering a few happy or error paths,
  to ensure classes/components can communicate with each other successfully.
- Perhaps some UI tests, if needed. These are the most brittle
  and are only for smoke testing.

Cover the code paths you add, especially business-critical ones.
Coverage is measured on every pull request and gated against a threshold.
But don't sacrifice test quality for a coverage metric.

## Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits][cc]
to standardize the format of commit messages.
This enables the automation of e.g. versioning
and the generation of changelogs & release notes.
See the [local documentation][ccFile] for more information.
